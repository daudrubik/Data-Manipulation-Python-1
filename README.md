# Data-Manipulation-Python-1

## Use Case
### Use Case Summary
#### Objective Statement :
* Get new insight about the fundamental of data manipulation with Python
* Get the insight about object series
* Get the insight about loc and iloc
* Get the insight about data frame in Python
#### Challenges :
* Python is a case sensitive programming laguage, so the writing of the syntax must be considered
* A lot of new things about data manipulation will be learned here, so it needs a detailed and easy understand explanation
#### Expected Outcome :
* Understand the basics knowledge that needed to manipulate data using python
* Knowing the difference between implisit and explisit index
* Knowing the difference between loc and iloc
* Knowing how to convert data into object series and data frame
#### Benefits :
* As a basic material before manipulating actual data using Python
* As additional knowledge about object series, loc and iloc, and data frame in Python

### Outlines
#### Data Manipulation
* Manipulation data it's not to change the data value. 
* Data manipulation make the data easier to read by machine.
#### Object Series
* Has one dimension of data.
* Only has one column.
* Does not have a column name.
* Has an index.
* Can change the data (example: list or tuple type) into object series.
#### Loc and Iloc
* Loc and Iloc are methods in the Pandas library
* Loc  is used to call an explicit index
* Iloc is used to call an implisit index
#### Data Frame
* A Pandas DataFrame is a 2 dimensional data structure, like a 2 dimensional array, or a table with rows and columns
* Data frame is a part of pandas library.
